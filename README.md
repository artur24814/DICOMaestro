## API Documentation for Developers
This documentation describes the steps for developers to authenticate and interact with the API to manage their API keys and work with DICOM files.

### Prerequisites
Before interacting with the API, developers must have an account on our platform and obtain an access token. This token will be used for authentication in subsequent requests.

## Authentication
### 1. Obtain an Access Token
To interact with the API, developers must first authenticate by obtaining an access token. This token will be used in the Authorization header to make authenticated requests.

Endpoint
* URL: `/api/token/`
* Method: `POST`
* Description: This endpoint accepts user credentials and returns an access token and a refresh token.
#### Request
You need to send a `POST` request to the `api/token/` endpoint with the following payload:

```json
{
  "email": "user5@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```
#### Response
If authentication is successful, you'll receive a response containing the access and refresh tokens:

```json
{
  "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9....",
  "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXV......"
}
```
* access: Use this token in the `Authorization` header as   `Bearer <access_token>` for authenticated requests.
* refresh: Use this token to refresh the access token when it expires.
## Developer Profile
Once you have the access token, you need to create a developer profile before you can obtain an API key.

### 2. Create a Developer Profile
To register your profile as a developer, send a POST request to the `api/developer/profiles/` endpoint with the following details.

Endpoint
* URL: `/api/developer/profiles/`
* Method: `POST`
* Description: This endpoint creates a new developer profile.
#### Request
Include the Authorization header with your Bearer access token and the profile information in the request body:

```json
{
  "purpose": "testing",
  "organization": "My Organization"
}
```
#### Response
If the profile creation is successful, you will receive a 201 Created status along with the details of your new profile:

```json
{
  "purpose": "testing",
  "organization": "My Organization"
}
```
* Status 201 Created: Indicates that the profile has been successfully created.

## API Key Management
After creating your developer profile, you can obtain and manage your API keys.

### 3. List and Create API Keys

Once your profile is set up, you can create and list your API keys.

Endpoint
* URL: /api-keys/
* Method: `GET`, `POST`
* Description:
    * `GET`: Retrieves the list of API keys associated with your developer profile.
    * `POST`: Creates a new API key for your developer profile.
#### Request
To list the API keys, send a `GET` request with the `Authorization` header:

```http
GET /api-keys/ HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
To create a new API key, send a `POST` request with the following `JSON` payload:

```http
POST /api-keys/ HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

{
  "name": "New API Key"
}
```
#### Response
* GET `/api-keys/`:
    * Status 200 OK: A list of API keys.
* POST `/api-keys/`:
    * Status 201 Created: The newly created API key.

Example Response for `POST`:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "New API Key",
  "key": "API_KEY_12345"
}
```
* key: This is the actual API key you will use to authenticate API requests.
4. Delete API Key

You can delete an existing API key by specifying its ID.

Endpoint
* URL: `/api-keys/delete/<str:pk>/`
* Method: `DELETE`
* Description: Deletes the specified API key.
### Request
To delete an API key, send a `DELETE` request to the URL `/api-keys/delete/<pk>/` with the `Authorization` header:

```http
DELETE /api-keys/delete/1/ HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
### Response
If the deletion is successful, the API will return a 204 No Content status:

```json
{
  "detail": "Key deleted successfully."
}
```
## Example API Key Flow
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example to help you understand the process:

### Step 1: Obtain an Access Token
Send a POST request to the `/api/token/` endpoint with your email and password:

```json
{
  "email": "user5@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```
Response:

```json
{
  "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```
### Step 2: Create Developer Profile
Use the access token to create your developer profile by sending a `POST` request to `/api/developer/profiles/`:

```json
{
  "purpose": "testing",
  "organization": "My Organization"
}
```
### Response:

```json
{
  "purpose": "testing",
  "organization": "My Organization"
}
```
### Step 3: Create an API Key
With the developer profile created, you can now request your API key. Send a `POST` request to `/api-keys/`:

```json
{
  "name": "New API Key"
}
```
### Response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "New API Key",
  "key": "API_KEY_12345"
}
```

## API Usage Limits

Each developer has access to the DICOM file upload endpoint up to 1000 times per month. To check your remaining usage, you can use the following endpoint:

To view the daily and monthly usage for your developer profile, send a `GET` request to the `activity-summary` endpoint.

Endpoint
* URL: `api/developer/profiles/activity-summary/`
* Method: GET
* Description: Retrieves the daily and monthly usage statistics for your API access.
#### Request
* Headers:
    * `Authorization`: `Bearer <access_token>`
#### Example Request:
```http
GET /api/developer/profiles/activity-summary/ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
#### Response
You will receive a response with your daily and monthly usage:

```json
{
  "daily_activity": [
    {
      "day": "2025-01-05",
      "count": 1
    }
  ],
  "monthly_total": 1
}
```
* `daily_activity`: An array showing how many requests have been made each day.
* `monthly_total`: The total number of requests made for the current month.
## Error Handling: API Limit Exceeded
If the monthly usage limit is exceeded, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response. The response will contain an error message indicating that the limit has been reached, and you will need to wait until the new month to refresh your quota.

#### Example Response for Exceeded Limit:

```json
{
  "error": "Monthly API request for '/api/dicom/read/file/' limit exceeded.",
  "quota": 1000,
  "requests_used": 1001
}
```
* `error`: A description of the error, including the endpoint and the exceeded limit.
* `quota`: The maximum number of requests allowed per month for that endpoint.
* `requests_used`: The number of requests that have been used during the current month.

Once the limit is reached, you will need to wait for the start of the new month for your API request quota to reset.
